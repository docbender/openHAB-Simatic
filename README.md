## Introduction

This binding for openHAB has ability to connect Simatic PLC over Ethernet with isoTCP. So it should be possible to connect to the Simatic PLC S7-300, S7-400, S7-1200 and S7-1500 series.  

Binding uses libnodave library to provide connection (https://sourceforge.net/projects/libnodave/).

More about this can be found on wiki page: https://github.com/docbender/openHAB-Simatic/wiki

Compiled binding is inserted into release branch: https://github.com/docbender/openHAB-Simatic/releases

Binding is working with openHAB 3.0
